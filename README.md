# Diabetes-Prediction--KNN

### About the Project

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not.

### How it Works

KNN works by:
  
             1. Choosing a number K.
             
             2. Measuring distance between the new data point and all training points.
             
             3. Picking the K closest neighbors.
             
             4. Making a prediction based on the majority class of those neighbors.
